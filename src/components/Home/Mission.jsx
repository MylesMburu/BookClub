      Our mission as a Book Club project is to find ways to put books into the hands of young minds in these secluded community spaces, which would only have access to the outside world within the confines of whichever institution life puts them in.

      The average price of one second-hand book(a novel) falls under $1. With various purchasing options available, we intend to buy and distribute books that we could use to run a two-phase piloting project. The piloting program focuses on five pilot institutions and then exponentially grows the project after determining feasibility.
