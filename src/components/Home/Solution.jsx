        <p className='px-6'>Book Club is essentially an idea to set up a portable library where we identify, categorize and document individuals in these institutions, giving them a book they can pick from our catalog after reading the synopsis. After a set period, we exchange books and, if individuals want, notes with a different institution with the exact number of students and readers. To remain eligible for this exchange, the condition of one's book should be excellent lest one get a temporary or permanent suspension.</p>
